## Example projects

QuestSystem approach to make quests is mostly code based, but that won't stop anyone to extends the addon capabilities.

## Advanced Quest System example

In the [advanced-quest-system-example](https://github.com/shomykohai/advanced-quest-system-example/) the `Quest` class is extended by `BaseQuestResource` to achieve versatility and reusability of the same quest script. In addition, the approach taken in this example project allows the use of composition to make quests in the inspector.<br>
